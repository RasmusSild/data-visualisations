# Considering P5

The example in `./grafica` folder is based on `/d3/demo` by @RasmusSild
ported to **`p5.js/grafica`** by @valango.

I intentionally tried to keep the result visually as similar to original version as possible.

I used the [grafica.js](https://github.com/jagracar/grafica.js) **`p5.js`** library. It has
good examples, but not much documentation.
Code in [Java version](https://github.com/jagracar/grafica) is much better commented,
esp. when it comes to `GPlot` and `GLayer` classes.

### Why P5?
I think the tight connections w [Processing](https://processing.org/) community
will turn out to be real valuable in long run.
Besides, it's nice clean JavaScript and it fits well with our WebPack/ES5/TS stack.

### Links
* [p5.js home](https://p5js.org/) holds (almost) all the resources we could ask for.
* [p5.js examples](https://p5js.org/examples/) are real cool and are certainly worth of checking out!
* [grafica examples](https://jagracar.com/grafica.php) more specific fun...
